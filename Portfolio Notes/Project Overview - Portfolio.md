To show off my all my work a central place is needed. Thereby the creation of my portfolio. Here I planned to show all the projects I've worked on as well as to offer some, in depth explanations, to some of the systems I created along the way. Therefore I went to the drawing board to create a set of project specifications. 
My project would have to have:

- A Homepage, detailing:
	- Who I am
	- What I do
	- What I've done (past projects)
	- How to contact me
- A Project page to see all my projects
- A Blog page hosting any text explanations like this one
- A contact page where all my contact information would be listed including a form to contact me directly from the site

With that in mind I went to the first big leg of the process:
# Designing the pages
Designing the pages was a huge task as it was a lot of back and forth between thinking I made a bulletproof design and implementering it, just to realize the headache I set myself forth. 
My first design was a boxy flex design with ease of programming in mind. Here everything would be separated into neat little boxes that again could be put in more boxes. This led to a design focusing on thin lines, down-to-earth tones, and perfect squares.

Here its clear that I wasn't focused on a style as I was more focused on making the website work. I did however still make a sheet detailing my typefaces, sizes, and colours in adobe XD.
This however is nothing like what you see now as I became unhappy with the result. The result looked like a portfolio but not like *my* portfolio. So back to the drawing board:
## A Second Iteration
In the second iteration of my homepage I started from scratch with a moodboard of other portfolios I liked and a general style I thought was interesting. Here are some of them.

Further more I knew I wanted something vibrant, playful and feminine, so I chose to go with a pink colour as my primary. With that i got to sketching out a hero page.

This ended up being the first draft, and a draft i was happy with for a long time so I went on to make the rest of the sections i needed
